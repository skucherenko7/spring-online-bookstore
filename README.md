## **Progect "BookStore App"**

Welcome to the *scalable and modular RESTful API** — **BookStore  Backend**.  
This project is built using modern technologies such as **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **Spring Security**, **Spring Data JPA**, **Swagger**, **Docker**, and more.

### **Project Purpose**

The goal of this application is to provide full functionality for an online bookstore:
- manage users and authentication;
- manage and browse books, categories;
- handle shopping carts and order processing.

    The project includes **robust security mechanisms**, **role-based access control**, and **interactive API documentation** via Swagger.

### **Project structure**

This project is an application with a multi-level architecture:
 - model layer - defines domain entities and data transfer objects (DTOs);
 - repository layer - interacts with the database using Spring Data JPA;
 - service layer - characterized by the presence of business logic, and is also an intermediary between repositories and controllers;
 - controller layer - controller Layer: Exposes RESTful endpoints and handles HTTP requests/responses.

### **How to start working with the project**

  Want to quickly run a Spring Boot application locally? Here is a step-by-step guide.

## 1. Check the necessary tools.

Before starting, make sure you have the following components installed:

![Scheme](scheme-system-requirements.png)

---

## 2. Cloning the project from GitHub: 

+ fork the repository:
        - [go to the page] (https://github.com/skucherenko7/spring-online-bookstore);
        - click the **Fork** button in the upper right corner;
        - select your GitHub account or organization.
    
    You have your own copy of the project now!

+ clone the fork locally:
        - use terminal to clone.
```
git clone https://github.com/skucherenko7/spring-online-bookstore.git
cd spring-online-bookstore
```
---

## 3. Environment settings.

  In the root folder, create an .env file with the following content:
```
MYSQLDB_USER=your_data
MYSQLDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_data
MYSQLDB_DATABASE=your_data
MYSQLDB_LOCAL_PORT=your_data
MYSQLDB_DOCKER_PORT=your_data
SPRING_LOCAL_PORT=your_data
SPRING_DOCKER_PORT=your_data
DEBUG_PORT=your_data
JWT_EXPIRATION=your_data
JWT_SECRET=your_data
```
---
      
## 4. Launching the application using Maven or Docker:

   **Run the Application Using Maven**
- Use the following command to launch the Spring Boot application:
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Verify the Application is Running
- If successful, you will see logs ending with something like:
```
Started BookstoreApplication in X.XXX seconds (process running for X.XXX)
```

   **Or using Docker to run app**

- Build Docker image
```
docker build -t bookstore-app:1.0 .
```

- Run the container
```
docker run -p 8088:8080 bookstore-app:1.0
```

Now that Spring Boot application is running, you can use Postman (or any other REST client) to test its API endpoints.

## 5. Getting Started with API with Postman.

Before starting, make sure **Postman** is installed on your local machine.
+ To get started, you must authenticate as an admin and obtain a JWT token.

*Method:* **POST** `http://localhost:8088/api/auth/login`

*Example body:*

```json
{
"email": "admin@example.com", 
"password": "Password999"
}
 ```

+ Add the received token to each request in the Authorization Header as a Bearer Token.
+ After you authenticate and get a JWT token, you can create a category.

*Method* **POST** `http://localhost:8088/api/categories`

*Example body:*

```json
{
"name": "Funny", 
"description": "Funny books"
}
```

+ Once you've created a category, you can add a new book.

*Method* **POST** `http://localhost:8088/api/books`

*Example body:*

```json
{
"title": "Lisova pisnya",
"author": "Ukrainka",
"isbn": "978-1234567979",
"price": 670.00,
"description": "Updated description",
"coverImage": "https://example.com/updated-cover-image.jpg",
"categories": [2,6]
} 
```

**If you perform the Admin functionality, you will be able to:**
+ view all books;
+ get book details by ID;
+ create, update, or delete books;
+ search books by parameters;
+ manage categories: create, update, delete, view;
+ manage orders: view all, update status.


If you want to test the application as a regular user, you must register by creating a new account:

*Method* **POST** `http://localhost:8088/api/auth/registration`

*Example body:*

```json
{
"email": "myron111@ukr.net",
"password": "Password111",
"repeatedPassword": "Password111",
"firstName": "Myron",
"lastName": "Myron",
"shippingAddress": "22 Main St, Cherkasy, Ukraine"
}
```

+ After registering a new user, you need to log in to obtain a JWT token.

*Method* **POST** `http://localhost:8088/api/auth/login`

*Example body:*

```json
{
"email": "myron111@ukr.net",
"password": "Password111"
}
```

+ After getting the token, you can add a book to your shopping cart.
+ Just don’t forget to include the token in the Authorization header as a Bearer token every time.

*Method* **POST** `http://localhost:8088/api/cart`

*Example body:*
```json
{
"bookId": 20,
"quantity": 2
}
```

+ Before creating an order, you can review your shopping cart to ensure everything is correct.

*Method* **GET** `http://localhost:8088/api/cart`

+ If something is wrong with your selection, you can delete books from your shopping cart or change their quantity.

*Method* **DELETE** `http://localhost:8088/api/cart/{book_id}`

*Method* **PUT** `http://localhost:8088/api/cart//items/{book_id}`

*Example body:*
```json
{
"quantity": 5
}
```

+ Now we can place an order.

*Method* **POST** `http://localhost:8088/api/orders`

*Example body:*
```json
{
"shippingAddress": "22 Main St, Cherkasy, Ukraine"
}
```

+ We can review all our orders.

*Method* **GET** `http://localhost:8088/api/orders`

**Also as a User you can:**

+ review all books;
+ get books by ID or search by parameters;
+ review all categories;
+ get books by ID;
+ get books by category;
+ get order by ID.
